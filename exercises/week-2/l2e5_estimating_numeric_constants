This exercise has been inspired by the book [Structure and
Interpretation of Computer Programs][1] by Harold Abelson and Gerald
Jay Sussman with Julie Sussman.  The full text is available on the Web
and licenced under a CC BY/NC licence and is highly recommended
reading as a great introduction to Computer Science!  Of particular
interest in connection to this exercise are sections 1.3 and 3.5,
which include similar exercises.  Also, Sean Devlin's excellent video
[Infinite Sequences][2] shows how certain numeric problems can be
solved very elegantly using lazy sequences; familiarity with that
material may be helpful.


Estimating numeric constants
----------------------------

Quite a number of important constants in mathematics are known to be
the limits of some alternating series.  Examples include π, e, ln 2
etc.  Finding an appropriate series and proving that it converges to a
particular constant is quite tricky; once such a series has been
found, computing an approximation to the constant can be as simple as
summing up a large number of initial terms of the series.  One problem
with this approach is that oftentimes such series converge to the
desired value with no great rapidity; one can, however, greatly speed
up the process by applying the following simple technique (related to
[Euler's transformation][3] and [van Wijngaarden's modified
version][4] of it):

 1. the initial sequence is transformed into a sequence of its partial
   sums;

 2. the partial sums sequence is repeatedly subjected to average
   damping (the process whereby a sequence of numbers -- let it be
   called 'input' -- is replaced by a sequence of averages of adjacent
   terms of the input);

 3. an arbitrary cut-off point is chosen: after that many applications
   of average damping, the first term of the resulting (thoroughly
   average damped) sequence is used.

This results in a much better approximation to the limit of the
alternating series than simple calculation of partial sums.

Here is an example (following the section called [Estimating π][5] of
the Wikipedia π article):

 1. The Gregory-Leibniz series is defined as the (infinite) sum of
   terms of the form

   (-1)^n
   ------
   2n + 1

   (that's $\frac{-1^n}{2n+1}$ for those who prefer TeX to ASCII art
   fractions; or (/ (Math/pow -1 n) (inc (* 2 n))) in Clojure).

   It has the interesting property that π is equal to four times its
   limit.

 2. The initial terms are 4/1, -4/3, 4/5, -4/7, ...; thus the initial
   sums are 4/1, (4/1 - 4/3), (4/1 - 4/3 + 4/5), ...

 3. Average damping the sequence of initial sums produces a sequence
   of the form (4/1 + (4/1 - 4/3)) / 2,
   ((4/1 - 4/3) + (4/1 - 4/3 + 4/5)) / 2 etc.

 4. The resulting transformation is also subjected to average damping,
   as is the result of that step and so on.

 5. At some point during the process, we take the first element of the
   sequence produced by the latest round of average damping and use it
   as our approximation to π.

For this exercise, please translate the above description into Clojure
code.  Try to decouple the steps as much as possible; for example,
transforming a sequence into a sequence of its partial sums should be
performed by a separate function, as should a single round of average
damping.

Once you are done, please consider the following questions:

 1. Are your sequence operations lazy?

 2. Would you expect to be able to use your code to compute
   arbitrarily good approximations?

 3. In which ways do you feel that the answers to (1) and (2) above
   actually matter?

Finally, if you feel like it, plug in some other alternating series to
get some good approximations to other numeric constants, experiment
with Sean's simple-converge function [from the video][2] etc.
