Writing a `xor` macro
=====================

Clojure implments `and` and `or` as macros.  You can see their implementation
at the REPL by running:

    (use 'clojure.contrib.repl-utils)
    (source or)
    (source and)

In this exercise you will write a macro for exclusive or, `xor`, that will
return a value that evaluates to true if and only if one argument evaluates to
true.  It should only evaluate as many forms as necessary to determine the
result of the macro.  In other words, as soon as the second true value is
found, the macro should stop.

You may modify the file `xor.clj`, which contains some tests to determine if
your macro is behaving correctly.


Step 1: Nullary `xor`
---------------------

Modify the macro stub to support the nullary (no argument) form of `xor`, which
should return `nil`.  The `nullary` test should now succeed.


Step 2: Unary `xor`
-------------------

Now add an unary (one argument) form to `xor`.  You should be able to uncomment
the `unary` test and have it succeed.


Step 3: Binary `xor`
--------------------

Now add an binary (two argument) form to `xor`.  You should be able to
uncomment the `binary` test and have it succeed.


Step 4: n-ary `xor`
-------------------

Now add an n-ary (variadic) form to `xor`.  You should be able to uncomment the
`ternary` and `n-ary` tests and have them succeed.

Congratulations!  You have now created a macro for logical exclusive or.


Bonus Step
----------

Note the highly repetitive nature of the various tests.  Write a macro to
eliminate much of the code duplication.
