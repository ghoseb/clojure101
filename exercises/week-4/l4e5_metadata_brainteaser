Metadata Brainteaser
====================

`defn-` is a macro that creates a named function, like `defn`, except that the
resulting name is non-public, i.e. its metadata `:private` is set to `true``.
There is no `def-` to create non-public vars, so a common idiom is to use
something like:

    (def #^{:private true} myvar "myvalue")

1. What is the result of `(meta myvar)`?
2. Is it what you expected?
3. How do you get the result you expect?
